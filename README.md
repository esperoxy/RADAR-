# RADAR-
building a radar system using HC-SR04(ultra sonic sensor) arduino 
let's build a simple radar system using hc-sr04 . thing we need are 

hc-sr04,servo motor, led, arduino uno or any board , jumping wires , bread board(not to imp).

the first thing you need it to connect the HC-SR04 to arduino, servo to arduino, led to arduino .
check circuit daigram for it 
then upload the code in arduino board .
check the values and improve the code accordingly . We have used led to notify wheather how near a object had reached.
if some object comes near it will start blinking fast and accordingly.

apperciate for support.
